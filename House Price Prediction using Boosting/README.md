This project predicts house prices using boosting techniques for both regression and classification tasks. 
The regression model estimates the exact house price based on features such as location, number of rooms, pools, square-foot area, and amenities. 
Additionally, a classification model categorizes properties into price ranges (low, medium, high) to simplify decision-making for buyers and real-estate analysts. 
The dataset was cleaned, missing values handled, and categorical variables encoded before training AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost models. 
This project demonstrates advanced feature engineering, boosting algorithms, and model deployment for real-world price prediction scenarios.
