This project predicts whether a customer will choose a term insurance plan and estimates the plan duration based on customer features such as age, income, default, housing, education, and financial behavior. 
The dataset was preprocessed by handling categorical variables using encoding techniques and preparing numerical data for model training. 
A Random Forest Classifier was used to predict whether a customer will opt for a term plan, and a Random Forest Regressor was used to estimate the expected duration of the plan. 
This project demonstrates end-to-end machine-learning workflow involving classification and regression in the same dataset, along with real-world business insights for insurance decision-making.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Random Forest Classifier & Regressor, Seaborn
