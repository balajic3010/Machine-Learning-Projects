This project predicts whether a hotel booking will be canceled using customer and reservation details such as booking date, stay duration, number of guests, deposit type, room preference, and special requests. 
The dataset was preprocessed by handling categorical features using Label Encoding and preparing numerical features for model training. 
Two machine-learning models — Decision Tree Classifier and XGBoost Classifier were trained to learn patterns associated with cancellations. 
The project helps analyze customer booking behavior and supports hotels in minimizing revenue loss by predicting high-risk cancellations.
