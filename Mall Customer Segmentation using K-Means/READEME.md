This project segments mall customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm. 
The dataset contains customer attributes such as gender, age, annual income, and spending score. 
Data preprocessing included handling categorical features, standardizing numeric variables, and selecting optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
After training the K-Means model, customers were grouped into meaningful clusters (e.g., high-income high-spenders, low-income low-spenders), enabling better customer targeting and business marketing strategies. 
Insights were visualized using scatter plots to clearly distinguish cluster patterns.

Technologies & Libraries Used :
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, K-Means Clustering
