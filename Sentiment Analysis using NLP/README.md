This project performs sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. 
Text data was cleaned and preprocessed using tokenization, stop-word removal, and normalization. 
The processed text was converted into numeric features using CountVectorizer, and a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier was trained to identify sentiment patterns. 
Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix, demonstrating effective sentiment classification through classical NLP and machine-learning techniques.

Technologies & Libraries Used :
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK, CountVectorizer, GaussianNB
