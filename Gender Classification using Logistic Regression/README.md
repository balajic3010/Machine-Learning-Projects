This project predicts gender (Male/Female) based on personal preferences such as favorite color, favorite music genre, beverage choice, and soft drink preference. 
The dataset contains only categorical features, so preprocessing included converting text values into numerical form using Label Encoding. 
After preprocessing, a Logistic Regression model was trained to learn the relationship between preference patterns and gender. 
The model was evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics, demonstrating how behavioral attributes can be used for prediction using classical machine learning techniques.

Technologies & Libraries Used :
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Logistic Regression

Key Concepts :
Label Encoding, Logistic Regression, Binary Classification, Model Evaluation
