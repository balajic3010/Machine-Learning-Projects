This project focuses on predicting airline ticket prices using dataset containing flight details such as airline, route, journey date, duration, and number of stops. 
The data was preprocessed by handling missing values, converting and extracting date-time features, encoding categorical variables, and applying feature scaling. 
Both Random Forest Regressor and Random Forest Classifier algorithms were applied to the dataset to experiment and compare model behavior for regression and classification tasks. 
The model learned patterns based on travel-related features and demonstrated effective performance in predicting airline fares through machine-learning-based analysis.

Technologies & Libraries Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Random Forest (Regressor & Classifier)
