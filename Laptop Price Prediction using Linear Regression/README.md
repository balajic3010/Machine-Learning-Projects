This project predicts laptop prices based on hardware specifications such as processor type, RAM size, GPU, screen resolution, and storage type. 
The dataset was preprocessed by handling categorical variables using pd.get_dummies() to convert them into numerical form. 
A Linear Regression model was trained to learn the relationship between laptop features and price. 
After training, the model was used to predict prices for unseen laptop configurations. 
This project demonstrates feature engineering, data preprocessing, and linear regression model building.

Technologies Used : Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
