This project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default using a loan default dataset. 
The dataset was preprocessed by applying label encoding for categorical features and preparing financial attributes such as income, loan amount, and credit history for modeling. 
A Decision Tree Classifier was trained to learn patterns from applicant data and classify borrowers into defaulter or non-defaulter, helping financial institutions assess loan risk. 
Model performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics to ensure reliable prediction results.
The model achieved an accuracy score of 80.20% , demonstrating strong performance in predicting loan default behavior.
